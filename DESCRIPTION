Description: 'Tplyr' is a package dedicated to simplifying the data manipulation necessary to create clinical reports. Clinical data summaries can often be broken down into two factors - counting discrete variables (or counting shifts in state), and descriptive statistics around continuous variable. Many of the reports that go into a clinical report are simply made up of these two scenarios. By abstracting this process away, 'Tplyr' allows you to rapidly build these tables without worrying about the underlying data manipulation.
